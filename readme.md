## Tailwind CSS Setup with Vite + React

This guide walks you through setting up Tailwind CSS in a Vite project using React.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1.✅ Install Tailwind CSS with Vite  
Setting up Tailwind CSS in a Vite + React project.

---

### 2.📁 Create Your Project

If you don't have a Vite project set up already, create one using the following commands:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-project -- --template react
cd my-project

### ⚙️ Configure Template Paths
Update the tailwind.config.js file to include your template paths:
```bash
    #Add code snippet here as ss link instead the code written in bash below
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

## 3.🎨 Add Tailwind Directives to CSS
In your ./src/index.css file, add the Tailwind directives:
```bash
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

## 4.🚀 Start Development Server
Start your local development server using:
```bash 
npm run dev

## 5.*💡 Start Using Tailwind
Now, you can start using Tailwind’s utility classes in your components.
Example App.jsx:
```bash
export default function App() { 
  return (
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
      Hello world!
    </h1>
  );
}

## Routing:
Routing determines how an application responds to a user request for a specific URL or endpoint.

## Rendering:
Renderng refers to displaying the content of a web page to the user.

**Types of Rendering:**
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR):

The HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client.
Benefits: Faster initial load time, SEO-friendly.
Example: Next.js.

---

- Client-Side Rendering (CSR):

The browser downloads a JavaScript bundle and renders the content dynamically.
Benefits: Faster transitions between pages after the initial load.
Example: React, Angular, Vue.

**Static Site Generation (SSG):**

HTML is pre-rendered at build time.
Benefits: Extremely fast load times, SEO-friendly.
Example: Gatsby.js.
Hybrid Rendering:

Combines SSR and CSR for different pages/routes.
Example: Next.js.
